                <b> Be Nice 2 Me by Bladee</b>
                <br />
                Just from the instrumental in the beginning, this song is hyperpop. The artist is singing what everyone
                would love to say "I dont wanna talk if youre not gonna talk to me nice". Its almost reminiscent of a
                boy in 2012 finally encountering his emotions. For the queer community hyperpop has become a way of
                expressing queer emotions through music.

                <br />
                This is Miley Cyrus' good girl gone bad album. This song in particular examines whether music or a
                person is the culprit of having a good time. It can be confusing when a song is so good! She shows her
                openness to experiment with these feelings. You cant knock it until you try it. She also shows that
                sometimes love and art can be the same.

                <br />
                You know its going to be a good day when you hear this one. Everyone loves a good romance song that is
                not only catchy but so upbeat! The instrumentals are iconic. The melody will stay in your head for days.
                Perhaps the best part is the height of the song. The tempo slows down and we beg for Eileen! The tempo
                gets faster and faster, and suddenly you're squealing! Whether Eileen ever went with them, we know this
                song will stay in our minds forever.
