            <b>My Own Summer (Shove It) by Deftones</b>
            <br />
            This song jumps right into an intense guitar riff. The singers soft-like voice allows it to work with the iconic instrumental. When the chorus comes though, the vocalist is no longer soft. He screams. But it becomes quiet again. It is a cycle. If you have ever wanted to feel like you're falling in love with a sneaky killer, this is a perfect song.

            <b> Exit Music (For a Film) by Radiohead</b>
            <br />
            Originally meant for Romeo & Juliet, this song will be your go to for any earth shattering moment. The song starts out with a quiet melody and soft vocals. It's slow, the planning of "escaping". The song builds and a sense of anticipation begins to form. 2/3s into the song and the desperation is seen. Desperation to leave a tragic situation and Anger towards those who caused it.

            <b>Space Oddity by David Bowie</b>
            <br />
            David Bowie is a genius for this song. He tells an extravagant story about traveling to space. The way Bowie captures the wonders of space travel with the instrumental while the lyrics tell you what is happening. The production of this song completely enhances the quality of the song.
