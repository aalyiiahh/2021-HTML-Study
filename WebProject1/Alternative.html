            This song is simply about the beauty of what we think of as common. It starts out sweet, the vocals smooth
            and the instrumental providing a nostalgic and uplifting mood. The chorus is even more soulful. You can feel
            the passion and awe of the colors that the artist talks about. As he says "It's a good day for me" and it
            will be when you hear this song.

            Prepare to be hit with an intense intro. It will make you want to rock out and scream out. In this song, MCR
            talks about living in a world that doesn't listen. It's hard when no one hears you, you feel inferior and
            could even become it. But MCR says otherwise, no matter how hard it is, never be afraid to do it alone.
            Forgive yourself because you're all you got. Soon enough you'll be heard.

            You will feel like you're on an uphill climb listening to this song. This song has to deal with how we dont
            realize our perceptions until after they happen. You can think something happened one way until a few years
            later, you realize what you were missing. This 11 minute song feels like it reaches a climax but it just
            becomes more disjointed and almost nauseating at how packed and tense it builds up to without a release.
